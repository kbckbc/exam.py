I have been working for Korea Securities Depository (KSD) since 2007; for my remarkable achievement, KSD will fully sponsor and financially support me while I pursue my MS degree. I would like to improve my software security knowledge and related skills during the Master of Science degree at PennState University. Especially, I would like to mainly focus on applications of security in programming languages because there is a huge amount of personal information in KSD, and a small mistake can lead to a big risk. Also, KSD is sure to increase its service on the web in the future, accurate and up-to-date information acquisition is essential for privacy protection. In this Statement of Purpose, I would like to highlight my motivation and qualifications based on my solid background and work experience, and my MS research plans.

I first encountered computers in elementary school, and since then, I never doubted that the computer was my destiny. When I was in middle school, I had already assembled computers for my acquaintances, and from high school I was interested in programming language C, so I taught myself. I started to study how to change hexa code to change the ability of characters in computer games. It may be common now, but in the early 1990s, I was one of the rarest students. In the end, my interest in computers led me to the Computer Science at POSTECH, one of the best universities in Korea. During my undergraduate study at POSTECH, I developed a solid background in programming. Because I believed that strong programming skills are essential for my future step, my coursework was primarily focused on programming languages, such as C/C++ and JAVA, as well as data structures and algorithms.

I have gained a lot of experience as a developer afor more than 13 years at KSD company that I joined after graduation. KSD is a company that acts like DTCC in the United States and serves as a back office for stock trading. After joining the company, I was surprised by two things. First, there were too many source overlaps. Second, I was surprised that KSD kept a lot of personal information. For example, Samsung Electronics' shareholder information for the settlement of accounts in 2020 is over 2.5 million. KSD kept all the information of thousands of shareholders in these corporations. However, there is no external service provided by KSD, so the perception and technology of personal security has not developed much. For KSD, I found what I could do first. I didn't know much about security, but I was familiar with optimization and reusable programs, so I made several service to optimize the KSD system which is called E-SAFE. I implemented repetitive manual tasks as a batch program and created a system that users could call batch program on demand. This improvement significantly reduced the workload of E-SAFE.

In recognition of my ability, I became a project leader in the development of an electronic securities system called E-SAFE within eight years of joining the company. Electronic securities is a large business that converts existing real securities into digital, and it took a long time of 3 years to analyze and develop. Since KSD is the only institution in charge of issuing securities in Korea, high reliability was an essential requirement. To achieve this, I changed the design and the structure of the system. Except for commonly used logic, I designed the system to have decreased functional dependency by separating it as simple domain units, but with low abstraction. Because of this design, developers could independently and simultaneously develop each service page, which surprisingly shortened the development time. The changed system structure increased modifiability so that enabled operators could easily change the function of service page without fully understanding the system for maintenance. It's been two years since E-SAFE opened and it's working perfectly.

In recognition of my contribution so far, I was selected as a fully funded employee to earn a master's degree at Penn State University. The reason why KSD sends me to PennState University is clear. Be an expert in in information security and contribute to KSD. KSD provides two services to the public: E-VOTE, an electronic shareholders' meeting service, and the other is CROWD FOUND, a public funding system. Both systems are public services and require a lot of security knowledge. Until now, KSD has not had many services for individuals, so there is a lack of information security know-how. I also realized that I need to acquire more up-to-date knowledge to expand KSD's service. Therefore, I want to develop myself more professionally and academically through Penn State University.

I strongly believe that I am a well-prepared candidate for my MS in terms of my strong motivation, firm background and solid experiences, and clear vision. After successfully completing my MS at the PennState University, I will return to KSD to help establish the company's security policy and help operate the public service with enhanced information protection.

Thank you very much for your time and attention.




In recognition of my contribution so far, I was selected as a fully funded employee to earn a master's degree at Penn State University. The reason why KSD sends me to PennState University is clear. Be an expert in in information security and contribute to KSD. KSD provides two services to the public: E-VOTE, Internet shareholder voting service, and the other is CROWD FOUND, a public funding system. Both systems are public services and the KSD is also planning to strengthen its mobile services. Until now, KSD has not had many services for individuals, so the weak point is web and mobile security. I am eager to work with professor Dr. Patrick Daniel, who is very well known in the security field for his contributions, because I think  his research on 'Smartphone application security' could teach many lessons about KSD's future mobile services.  Therefore, I want to develop myself more professionally and academically through Penn State University.


My desire to expand my knowledge and my passion to solve the problems facing the industry have motivated me to pursue Master degree in PennState University of Computer Science and Engineering. I think my educational background and work experience have given me the qualities I need to meet the rigors of this demanding course. I bring along with me a strong grasp of fundamentals in computer science, along with a desire to learn,  and a zest for challenges.

KSD는 향후 서비스를 늘리기 위해 Software Engineering 전문가가 절실합니다. 그래서 KSD가 UNC ChapelHill 대학원에서 석사학위를 위한 모든 비용을 지원하는 것입니다. KSD 신규 개발되고 있는 몇몇 서비스는 아직도  수십년 전의 waterfall 개발 방식을 따르고 있으며, 대부분의 직원들이 개발 부담때문에 참여를 꺼려하고 있습니다. 그리고 한국 주식 시장의 back office 를 담당하고 있는 e-SAFE 시스템 내부에도 스파게티 소스 코드가 많아서 신규 서비스를 수용하기가 쉽지 않습니다. 저는 유명한 David Stotts 박사와 함께 연구를 진행하고 싶은데, 특히 'Design Pattern Analysis and Science of Design'을 적용한다면 KSD 의 e-SAFE 시스템을 변화에 좀 더 유연하게 개선시킬 수 있다고 생각합니다. UNC ChapelHill 대학원은 전문적이고 학문적으로 능숙해지기 위해 제 학업을 발전시키는 곳이 될 것입니다.
